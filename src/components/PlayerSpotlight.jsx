              Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr. (born July 15, 1990[1]) is an
              American professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of
              the National Basketball Association (NBA). Regarded for his big
              shots in the clutch, he has been nicknamed "Dame Time". He played
              college basketball for the Weber State Wildcats and earned
              third-team All-American honors in 2012. He was selected by the
              Portland Trail Blazers with the sixth overall pick in the 2012 NBA
              draft, and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year for the 2012â€“13
              season. With the team, he made seven NBA All-Star selections,
              seven All-NBA Team selections, and is the franchise's all-time
              leading scorer. In 2021, Lillard won a gold medal for the U.S.
              Olympic team in the 2020 Summer Olympics. That same year, he was
              named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[2] In 2023, after a trade
              request, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. Off the court,
              Lillard is also a rapper, under the stage name Dame D.O.L.L.A. He
              released his first studio album, The Letter O (2016), which
              charted on the Billboard 200, while his second and third albums,
              Confirmed (2017) and Big D.O.L.L.A. (2019), placed on the indie
              charts. In 2021, he released a fourth album, Different on Levels
              the Lord Allowed.
